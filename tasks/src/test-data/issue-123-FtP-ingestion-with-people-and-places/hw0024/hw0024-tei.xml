                    <p xml:id="OTPS91624P0">MacLeod moved to Gunaikurnai Country in the 1840s, with his father and brothers. They leased a range of stations across what became Gippsland. In May 1861, MacLeod was appointed Honorary Correspondent of the Central Board for watching the interests of the Aborigines. At this stage MacLeod was identified as living at Buchan River in Gipps Land. John Bulmer headed to Buchan when he came to Gippsland from Melbourne in 1861, guided by Brabralung man Tulaba. Guardian of the Aborigines, William Thomas, had determined a site near MacLeod’s station at Buchan River would be a good place for an Aboriginal reserve. However, Bulmer reported the local Brabralung people suggested Bulmer accompany them to Bung Yarnda where they were going fishing. It was here, at what became known as Lake Tyers, that Bulmer set up the Aboriginal reserve. Bulmer noted that MacLeod’s sister had taught local Brabralung women how to sew and that men were employed as stock riders by MacLeod.<lb/>
By March 1862 MacLeod was at Orbost and continued as Honorary Correspondent. MacLeod first claimed the Orbost run in 1847 and moved between it and a run at Ensay and Buchan over the years. MacLeod and his brothers experienced violence on a number of fronts in these early years as settlers contested poorly acknowledged and formalised land claims and Gunaikurnai people resisted incursions by the settlers on their Country and retaliated against violence against their people. In 1861 an overseer at MacLeod’s run Ensay was shot and killed by a neighbour, accused of taking cattle from the neighbour’s property. Some time around 1850-1851, the cook at MacLeod’s Orbost station, Dan Moylan or Dan Dempsey, was killed by Krauatungulung people in retaliation for the abduction, and rape of a young female. Local settlers formed a group to seek out Aboriginal people in revenge and killed between 15 to 20 people in the vicinity of Brodribb River. Another settler remembered that John’s brother, Norman, gathered a group of settlers from Sale to retaliate an attack on himself as he attempted to mount his horse (where this attack happened is not identified, but given he went to Sale, it was most likely around that area). After the killing of Aboriginal people in retaliation for Dan the cook’s death, a surviving Aboriginal boy was brought to the Orbost station and raised there. <lb/>
Historian Peter Gardner has written on and off over the past few decades about the history of Gippsland, with a particular focus on the shared history between settlers and Aboriginal people. His research and his regular revisiting of the materials to add and question the information and conclusions he has drawn is impressive. Gardner noted most recently regarding the MacLeods and massacres of Gunaikurnai in Gippsland, that there were two massacres that could be linked to the MacLeods – one at Mille or Milly creek on the Brodribb river and the ‘Slaughterhouse’ massacre north of Buchan. The University of Newcastle Colonial Frontiers mapping project links the Mille creek massacre with revenge for the death of Dan. The Slaughterhouse massacre resulted in around 15 to 20 Aboriginal people dead. Both sources note the secrecy over decades around these acts of violence, especially the Slaughterhouse massacre.<lb/>
MacLeod was a friend of the Howitt’s from the 1860s, visiting them when they were living at Omeo. MacLeod’s encounter of his pursuing Aboriginal people for killing livestock does not describe a massacre, but does indicate the tensions that existed between Gunaikurnai and settlers and presents MacLeod as dogged in his pursuit of the Gunaikurnai. <lb/>

reported finding part of a bible at the <rs ref="#S52988">Hart</rs> - near a <lb/>
place called <rs ref="#S61752">Marly Point</rs>.  He found it at a Blacks <lb/>
camp - where he thought he saw a [black- crossed out] white woman<lb/>
among the gins.  A great many people went out to <lb/>
see if they could find her.  I  went out with a black <lb/>
fellow <rs ref="#S26184">Ulmin</rs> of <rs ref="#S13203">Omeo</rs> who was then living with <lb/>
me at <rs ref="#S16886">Buchan</rs>. We went poking about – partly <lb/>
to catch a gin for him and to see if I could find the <lb/>
white woman. The Blacks greatest wish was to get a gin.<lb/>
- It was said she was down at the <rs ref="#S17753">Snowy river</rs><lb/>
- that the blacks had removed her out of the way <lb/>
of the whites to a place called [Dooruck - crossed out] <rs ref="#S52989">Duroc</rs>.  <lb/>
In looking for the blacks we found what is now <lb/>
called the <rs ref="#S52990">Snowy River station</rs>. The country at that time <lb/>
looked beautiful covered with grass and nice <lb/>
lightwood trees, and emus in lots. We found any <lb/>
number of blacks – we came on a lot camped on a piece <lb/>
of clear ground, open forest – they had never been disturbed <lb/>
there; we sneaked up on foot and caught an old <lb/>
man and three boys – the old man was old <rs ref="#S52991">Bungil <lb/>
woorin</rs> – or Brokensun. They were frightened out of their <lb/>
lives. The other two men and two gins ran right away <lb/>
from us. We thought it best after making friends with <lb/>
our captives to clear out. Finding no trace of the

in a tree W G.- we went back and shortly after I went<lb/>
up with cattle and took possession.

<p xml:id="OTP581754P1">Through old Bunjil woorin and the two boys, when <lb/>
I went the second day there I made friends with all the<lb/>
blacks. Old Bunjil woorin and I changed names - I took<lb/>
his and called him Jacob, he give me two children<lb/>
a young gin [two y- crossed out] four years old and a boy two years old. <lb/>
They were a nuisance to him because he could not <lb/>
feed them. The old wretch bothered me out of my life <lb/>
he used to come at 3 o’clock in the morning and sing out <lb/>
Phoebe canyu  ganyuce - that is Phoebe – the little gin <lb/>
is hungry – This old man brought in all the tribe <lb/>
about 70 men and 30 women and 15 or 16 children<lb/>
– it was the largest muster I ever saw there. The children <lb/>
were the most miserable little wretches I ever saw, with <lb/>
bellies like washing tubs and legs as thin as your finger <lb/>
– they looked like distorted frogs?. I used to laugh at them <lb/>
for hours. I then made enquiries about the white woman<lb/>
thinking they had her planted - I found there had<lb/>
been one among them and that she landed in a boat<lb/>
in the <rs ref="#S26185">90 mile beach</rs> with two white men. One of the <lb/>
white men went mad and they killed him to get<lb/>
rid of him. I could never trace what became of the<lb/>
other. The woman was drowned with her two half cast

children by the upsetting of a boat in <rs ref="#S17587">McLennans<lb/>
Straight</rs>.  I gathered this at different times. They used<lb/>
to describe her as a tall women with long very black hair <lb/>
reaching to her waist - a great sign of beauty with them. <lb/>
After getting the blacks in they were very quiet for<lb/>
10 days or a fortnight - used to bring me fish for which<lb/>
for which I gave them beef or potatoes or any little thing I could <lb/>
spare – till one night they all disappeared but two or<lb/>
three old men who remained as spies. Two or three <lb/>
days after I found these old fellows had changed their <lb/>
camp into a little mound near the river and a <lb/>
short time after we found a bullocks head the only <lb/>
remains of a beast that had been speared and <lb/>
taken away. The old blacks said it was not them <lb/>
but the <rs ref="#S70927">Bidwall</rs> blacks – who by the way are still <lb/>
wild and have never been brought in – they live <lb/>
somewhere out to this day towards <rs ref="#S17041">Cape Howe</rs>. <lb/>
We went after the blacks when we found [?but we had none?] <lb/>
killed – I and <rs ref="#S26188">Billy Simpson</rs>, and a black boy went out on<lb/>
foot each armed with a double gun each. After a <lb/>
walk of five tiring miles we fell in with them but they <lb/>
were over the river. I knew them as the very tribe that<lb/>
had been at our place. They were sitting by this fire<lb/>
with the spears stuck in the ground - they were scraping<lb/>
and ressing possum skins.

We wanted them to come over the river but they <lb/>
said the river was too high. My black boy and I both <lb/>
understood enough of their language to make them<lb/>
understand us and to understand them. They said <lb/>
there were no bullocks. They were in high glee, dancing <lb/>
and slapping their legs at us as a token of defiance. <lb/>
They thought they were out of reach so I gave them a shot,<lb/>
it struck in the mud and sent it all over them. <lb/>
They ran into the scrub frightened out of their lives. <lb/>
After a time out they came again, singing “Knart <lb/>
bun, a burry burrya nyu, Knart bun jerrumbuddy <lb/>
boorlooka nyu” – that is – “Don’t shoot me, I didn’t spear <lb/>
the bullock”. So we fired three rounds over their heads and <lb/>
they cleared out into a dense scrub and reeds.<lb/>
From this time they set to work – in one week <lb/>
- rainy weather, they killed 20 to 30. We could not go out.<lb/>
I only had 2 white men, a black and myself on the <lb/>
station and one man was laid up with reumatism [sic],<lb/>
and another was shepherding and the third and I <lb/>
were doing our best to get a hut up. The black boy <lb/>
was afraid to go away from the hut. All this time the <lb/>
blacks were working away at the cattle so that when we <lb/>
rode out Sunday we found that they had killed 15 or <lb/>
20 of out quietest cows. Most part they only took the<lb/>
tongues, kidneys and tails and left the rest for the crows

They left the rest for the crows - their friends who they <lb/>
believe brought them fire. They call them narroot. <lb/>
We were out for days but could never fall across them. <lb/>
They could get over the river and through the high ferns <lb/>
like wallabies – we had flying shots but never got <lb/>
any. The very next thing we found they had killed a lot <lb/>
of cattle at the bottom end of the run. I went down <lb/>
to see as I did not believe my black boy. I rode down <lb/>
unarmed as I had a young horse, About two miles or <lb/>
more from the hut I saw a native dog and having <lb/>
no gun took out my stirrup leather intending to <lb/>
kill him with the iron – my horse took fright a [sic] pitched<lb/>
me and the saddle on the ground. Instantly the scrub <lb/>
between me and the river seemed alive with blacks <lb/>
– I am sure the whole tribe were there, the yells made <lb/>
my flesh creep. I was in a deuce of a fright but I always <lb/>
had a brace of pistols in my belt and this was known <lb/>
to the blacks – so I took out a round brass tinderbox <lb/>
and holding it like a pistol made the best of my <lb/>
way home and although they followed me up in the scrub <lb/>
I never saw one – I think the fright was mutual <lb/>
– they were afraid to show up in reach of my supposed <lb/>
pistol and could not use their spears in the <lb/>
scrub.<lb/>
When I got home we went out armed but could <lb/>
not fall in with any of them<lb/>
