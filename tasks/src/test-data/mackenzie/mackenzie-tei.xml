My dear [Cassie]<lb/>
I wonder how big<lb/>
you are now. It will soon be two<lb/>
years since I saw you, so you<lb/>
must have grown  considerable in<lb/>
that time. But there is something<lb/>
else that I feel more anxious to know<lb/>
than your size – It was this – Are you<lb/>
a better girl now than you were<lb/>
two years ago? Do you love Jesus more<lb/>
and do you work more for Him. Re<lb/>
member you have not to come among <lb/>
the heathen in order to work for Jesus<lb/>
you can do this at home you can<lb/>
tell other little girls to love Him,<lb/>
biut more than this you can be<lb/>
kind to all at home and when others<lb/>
are are cross with you, love them for their <lb/>
hatred. "Render not evil for evil"

        <fw type="pageNum">2</fw>
        <p xml:id='OTP258P0'>This is quite a cool night. I had to go <lb/>
and put a warm coat on. I suppose you<lb/>
often wonder what I am doing. Well I<lb/>
have a great vriety of work. I was busy<lb/>
packing flour to-day. We have to [xx]<lb/>
careful with all our provisions in case<lb/>
they spoil. I suppose you often wonder<lb/>
what kind of food we have. To-day we<lb/>
had preserved beef – we get meat to buy<lb/>
in Sidney done up in tins air tight<lb/>
about the size of a tin pint. After a<lb/>
tin is opened it wont keep more than<lb/>
two days. It is already cooked so that <lb/>
we have only to warm it. We buy a <lb/>
great deal of it, indeed it is the principal<lb/>
part of our food. We also get fish pre<lb break='no'/>served the same way in small tins.<lb/>
Then to-day for dinner we had yams<lb/>
some days we have taro. The natives<lb/>
cook our yams for us the same way<lb/>
that they do their own – it would not be <lb/>
nice boiled, it would be soft.<lb/>
They roast them. If it is a small [xx]

        <div xml:id="OTP259">
        <fw type="pageNum">3</fw>
        <p xml:id='OTP259P0'>they lay it on the fire and keep turn<lb break='no'/>ing it until it is roasted, just as you<lb/>
would roast a potato. Some of our <lb/>
yams are very little bigger than a <lb/>
potato, but the small ones are de<lb break='no'/>licious, much niver than the large ones.<lb/>
When it is roasted they scrape the<lb/>
burnt skin off and then it is ready<lb/>
to eat. But I never saw them cook<lb/>
taro in this way nor large yams.<lb/>
When they make their fire they have <lb/>
a number of round stones which they<lb/>
put on the top of the fire, and then<lb/>
the stones are very hot – they put the<lb/>
taro or yams on top of the stones and<lb/>
cover them over with a great quantity <lb/>
of leaves – and the leaves keep the heat<lb/>
from escaping. By the time that<lb/>
the stones are hot the wood is about<lb/>
consumed, but they don't put on <lb/>
any more wood, there is heat enough<lb/>
in the stones themselves – Our girls take

        <p xml:id='OTP260P0'>turn about at cooking our yams.<lb/>
We have porridge for breakfast. We get beau<lb break='no'/>tiful oatmeal from Sidney in small<lb/>
tins. It would not do to get a larger<lb/>
quantity at once for it dont keep long<lb/>
We have plenty of milk. Mr Morrison<lb/>
let a cow here. I suppose you would<lb/>
like to see dear little [pepaxx]. She dont<lb/>
walk alone yet, but she runs along the <lb/>
wall or any place she can put her hand<lb/>
against. She talks away at a great rate<lb/>
and scolds too, but we dont know what<lb/>
she is saying. She didn't know me when<lb/>
I came home from the meeting, you<lb/>
may be sure I was not well pleased<lb/>
at her for forgetting me – Dear Ca[xx]<lb/>
I hope you are a good girl– and that<lb/>
you are seeking to followJesus. You<lb/>
remember dear [pepin] had not much<lb/>
time to think of death.<lb/>
I remain<lb/>
Your loving [brother]<lb/>
